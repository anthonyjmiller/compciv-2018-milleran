My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to identify which Senators have the least and most debt (liabilities in the disclosure form). Most Members of Congress are richer than the average US citizen, which sometimes means they have more debt as well. What type of debt is most common, and how much debt do Senators have in relation to their income and assets? Which Senators are outliers with regard to the amount of debt/liabilities they carry? Because some of the descriptions for 'type' of liability are not helpful (i.e. Promissory Note), I want to focus on common types such as Mortgage, Revolving Charges (credit card debt), and Educational Loans. It could also be interesting to measure the delta between years to see which Senators have incurred the most/least debt between a certain time period (most likely CY). 

Ways that I could visualize this data:
    -Group senators from highest to lowest amount of liabilities
    -Group senators by party, gender, state: which are the poorest/richest?
    -Group by outliers: are there senators who have an excessive amount of a specific liability?
    -Group by delta b/w years: which senators have gained/lost the most liabilities between a period of time?
    -Group by time length of liability: which liabilities (Mortgages, Educational Loans, Credit Card debt) appear for the longest time?
    -Group by liability type: which liabilities are the most common among senators?

"Financial disclosure forms for 2011 reveal that dozens of federal lawmakers owe thousands in student debt. According to CRP, the total owed among 22 Democrats and 24 Republicans adds up to between $1.8 million and $4.3 million. The exact amount is unknown because members of Congress are allowed to report debts in ranges, CRP reported."

"In general, senators are much wealthier than representatives, and they in turn are wealthier than the average American. But some senators are just like the rest of America: struggling to pay their mortgage."

"The John McCain campaign owes American Express $1.37 million in credit card debt and fees, according to Federal Election Commission filings... In June the McCain’s reported more than $100,000 in personal credit card debt. Reports on Cindy McCain’s personal finances have shown the beer heiress has charged as much as $500,000 in one month on an American Express card."

"Sen. Lindsey Graham's personal investment portfolio is small and simple compared to the portfolios of other senators and candidates for president. The South Carolina Republican's cash and mutual funds were worth between $216,000 and $740,000 in 2014, according to his latest financial report. He also reported mortgage debt of between $115,000 and $300,000."

Story #5: Bob Corker Facing Ethics Questions? What a Surprise

"But no one knew about Corker's private peccadilloes. It wasn't until Corker took office and filled out disclosure forms that his finances became public – sort of. Few in the media seem ever to have read the "liabilities" section of Corker's first disclosure, where the former mayor and construction magnate listed a series of massive outstanding loans. At the low end, Corker appeared to owe a hair-raising $24.2 million. At the high end, $120.5 million. He had been in debt to some of the nation's biggest lenders – including somewhere between $12 million and $60 million in debt to GE Capital alone."
